   Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
   unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one Teensy timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
   The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
   Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
   This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

/*
   Notes:
   Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
   Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
   variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
   the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
   When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
   if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
   If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
   or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.

   Switch Debouncing uses high frequency hardware timer 50Hz == 20ms) to measure the time from the SW is pressed,
   debouncing time is 100ms => SW is considered pressed if timer count is > 5, then call / flag SW is pressed
   When the SW is released, timer will count (debounce) until more than 50ms until consider SW is released.
   We can set to flag or call a function whenever SW is pressed more than certain predetermined time, even before
   SW is released.
